# BYU-Agent-2016

This is the source code for the agent that [won](http://atkrye.github.io/IEEE-CIG-Text-Adventurer-Competition/2016/11/07/Results/) the IEEE CIG 2016 Text-based adventure AI Competition. It has been formatted to work with [autoplay](https://github.com/danielricks/autoplay).

## Usage

The following files go in the agents directory:
* byuAgent.py
* verbFinder.py
* master_verbs.p (available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3lpCS07rg43TldDMnVIbnUtOEk)))

The agent functions as normal within the autoplay framework.
